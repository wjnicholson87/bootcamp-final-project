# Project Outline

Final Project
Luke, Brett, Bill
First Segment To Do:

1. Decide on a topic for the projectâ€”think of a question that can be answered using data.
Notes:
What scores would separate the average player compared to a top scoring player?
Would a machine learning module be able to predict who is a top player based on how many flawless matches they achieve? 
Compare players by region and consider tournament style? 
Can we use machine learning to guess live tournament victor based on current online tournament data? 

2. Create a repository for the project and invite the other team members to join.
Notes: 
Created reposotry and added all members.
Each member has branch.
Added step by step for branching. 

3. Source a dataset that will suit your needs (you can even use multiple datasets if applicable).
Notes:
First three data sets we considered.  
https://developer.start.gg/docs/intro
https://api.challonge.com/v1
https://developer.start.gg/reference/query.doc.html
Decided on start.gg for larger tournement live data and possible online match data. 

4. Begin to clean, organize, and perform exploratory data analysis on your datasets so that they're ready for analysis.
Notes:
Created a jupyter notebook to use pandas for exploritory analysis.
In process of creating data frame. 

Desired Features to be added to dataframe:
- Number of wins
- Number of losses
- Avg margin of victory
- Win percentage
- Character

5.Include mockups of a machine learning model and a database.
Notes:
Possibly feed the machine learning one tournament data and also on randomly generated tournament data set to add to model. 
Random forest as a possible algorithm
Preprocess the Data
Split into the training and testing sets
